q1

Consider the following training corpus of tagged sentences
the dog barks → D N V STOP
the cat sings → D N V STOP
Say we compute the maximum-likelihood estimates of a trigram hidden Markov model from this data. What is the value for the parameter e(cat|N) of this HMM?


e(cat|N) = count(cat, N) / count(N) = 1 / 2

q2

Consider the following training corpus of tagged sentences

the dog barks → D N V STOP
the cat sings → D N V STOP

Say we estimate the parameters for a hidden Markov model from this data using linear interpolation with λi=1/3 for i=1…3. 
What is the value of the parameter q(STOP|N,V) under this model?

q(STOP|N,V) = 1/3 * count(N, V, STOP) / count(N, V) + 1/3 * count(V, STOP) / count(V) + 1/3 * count(STOP) / count() = 1/3 * 2/2 + 1/3 * 2/2 + 1/3 * 2/8 = 2/3 + 1/12 = 3/4
